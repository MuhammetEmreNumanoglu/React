React Learning Repository

This repository was created to upload my work to GitHub regularly and simultaneously while learning React.

Purpose
- Learn the React ecosystem step by step  
- Reinforce what I learn through small examples and applications  
- Keep my development process version-controlled and trackable  

Content
Over time, this repository will include:
- React fundamentals  
- Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
- Component structures  
- Router and Redux experiments  
- Small demo projects  

Approach
Learn → Practice → Commit → Repeat

Each commit represents a newly learned concept or an improvement made during the learning process.

Technologies Used
- React  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Vite / Create React App  
- Git and GitHub  

Note
This repository serves as a learning and development journal.  
The code will improve over time, and older examples may be updated or refactored.

The React journey continues.
